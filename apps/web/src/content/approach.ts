/**
 * "The Beyond Learrning Approach" content and photography slots.
 *
 * To publish the photographs, add these files to `apps/web/public/images/home/`
 * (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.avif`, `.png` are also detected). The section picks them
 * up automatically; no layout change is needed:
 *
 *   approach-focused.webp      (Focused Preparation)
 *   approach-guidance.webp     (Strategic Guidance)
 *   approach-assessment.webp   (Regular Assessment)
 *   approach-mentorship.webp   (Personalised Mentorship)
 *
 * Recommended: vertical 4:5 portrait, 1200 × 1500 px (minimum 900 × 1125),
 * WebP at roughly 80% quality. The photographs are cropped into tall arched
 * panels (roughly 1:2 on wide desktops), so keep the subject in the CENTRE of
 * the frame and let the edges carry soft background.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: update each `alt` to describe the real photograph once added.
